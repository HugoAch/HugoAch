I'm currently working at the ISG-UAH group, but there are personal projects too.

ISG-UAH work is focused on time series forecasting in Emergency Services. We try to help managers in the resources planning task.

I'm interested in Deep Learning field, from Generative Learning to Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforced Learning.

Lifelong learner.
